# 12 · Stop, fail fast, re-deal: the room survives launch day

**Phase:** now · **Status:** planned

## Why
Two ways a room dies on Monday, both permanent. A friend closes their tab mid-answer: `conn.on("close")` (room.js:190–198) only removes the card, so the host waits out the 30 s / 90 s lap timeouts (865, 930, 968), `aiGenerate`'s catch leaves `ai.engine` set (1029–1033), `aiStart` early-returns on `ai.engine` (715), and nothing re-enables the start button (only `updateNeed` when `!ai.engine`, or the load-failure path at 805). Everyone reloads and re-types the code; guests whose host left still read "cluster online". Or a wrong-direction answer: the decode loops run to EOS or a literal 400 tokens (999, 1016) with no abort path, and at 3.5–6 tok/s cross-network that locks every screen behind `ai-busy` (1156) for up to two minutes. Roadmap 03 (spare copies, replay) is the right end state but is weeks away; this is the floor it sits on, and the master plan's NEXT metric ("median room survives one peer departure") is unreachable without it.

## Design
- **Stop.** An `ai.abort` flag checked between `specStep` iterations and between `aiPipeToken` calls; a Stop button replaces Send while busy on every screen; guests send `ai-stop`, honoured from the current asker or the host. The host still emits `ai-gendone` (`stats: "stopped at N tok"`) so every box unlocks, drops any in-flight `ai-hiddenret-b` by position (the `waiters` map already keys by pos) and leaves `ai.pos` consistent, which matters once item 13 keeps state across turns.
- **Fail fast on departure.** On `close`, if the peer is in `ai.chain` or is `ai.hostId`, reject every outstanding `ai.waiters` entry immediately with "X left (layers a–b)" and end the generation cleanly; drop the peer from `ai.chain` so `aiMaybeReady` can still fire when someone leaves during download.
- **Degraded → re-deal.** After a chain failure the room enters a "degraded" state. The host shows "Re-deal layers": the split planner in `aiStart` is factored into `planSplit()` and re-run over the remaining pledges, fresh `ai-load`s go out (cached ranges reload in seconds), and the host keeps the conversation text so it can re-prefill. The start button is re-enabled in the catch path regardless.
- **Guest side.** When the host connection closes, replace the pane with "the host left; this room is over" and a Create-room button.
- **Read `died`.** The joiner already sends `hello.died` from the localStorage crumb (361–362) and the `hello` handler ignores it; surface it as "phone came back; its tab was killed 40 s ago while streaming blk.30" so people learn that backgrounding Safari kills the peer.
- `ai-stop` is a new message and "degraded" is a new room state, so this file is the GOVERNANCE design note; `docs/protocol.md` gets a row for each. Roadmap 03 then adds spares and automatic replay on top of the same degraded → re-deal state and should be reworded to say so.

- **Automatic re-deal, prepared in the background, flipped at the next question.** The chain that is serving an answer is frozen for that answer. Joins and leaves both trigger a re-plan (`planSplit()` over measured time per layer and memory, not pledged memory alone):
  - *Join:* the newcomer takes a fair share and the others give up layers, so every device gains headroom (this is what "more devices scale what fits" means; each extra hop costs a little speed and the docs say so). The newcomer and any device gaining layers preload their new slices while the current answer streams; when every preload reports ready the host flips the plan at the next question and re-prefills the conversation on the new chain. Devices that gave up layers free the GPU memory but keep the bytes in the Cache API, which makes them warm spares.
  - *Leave:* the answer in flight stops (its layers are gone). The departed range goes first to whoever still has it cached, reloaded in seconds, and only hits the network if nobody does. If a spare already holds that slice (roadmap 03) the host flips to it directly. The next question works without anyone reloading.
  - *Manual re-deal button* on the host for "find the best split now", same planner, for when the automatic one was skipped or the room changed shape.

## Done when
- In a three-device room, closing one tab mid-answer surfaces the failure within 2 s, offers "Re-deal", and the next question is answered without anyone reloading.
- Pressing Stop on any screen ends generation within one lap and every Send box unlocks.
- A guest whose host left sees "this room is over" rather than "cluster online".
- A device joining a three-device room mid-answer is serving a slice by the next question without any reload, and joining during an answer never changes that answer's output.
- A device leaving mid-answer stops that answer within 2 s; the next question is answered by the remaining devices, with the departed range reloaded from cache where any device still has it.
- `docs/protocol.md` documents `ai-stop` and the degraded state. Fail-fast, the guest message and the start-button fix are ordinary bug-fix PRs and land first.
